# Skincare Wizard
## Introduction
The aim of this site is to help and educate female users about 
their skin. After a brief introduction to skin types, users will be 
asked to input their age group, followed by a small questionaire about 
their own skin and any issues they may have.
The site will then offer them a product on the high end price and a 
drugstore alternative to suit a lower budget and information regarding each.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this website is to provide education for female users
about skincare. I am a qualified beauty therapist and my experience has shown me that 
a lot of confusion surrounds skincare, there are thousands of products on the market
amd many are using the wrong products for their skin type which can lead to further 
skin issues or making current issues worse. High end brands can be very expensive so the
drugstore alternatives are there to suit lower budgets.

### Future Planning
There are many steps this site can take for the future, mens skincare is just as important and woukd need
to be added, different brands to suit different budgets, skincare brands sections and 
beauty salons/skin clinics could adapt this application to include products they sell.

### User Experience

The first time user goal is to be educated, see what the site is about and
hopefully get some answers to skin issues, they have the option to set up a profile so 
the app will remember their details and skin information each time they log in.
Even without registering a profile, a first time user will gain some knowledge
about different skin types and what can help them.

- Returning User- <br>
A returning user may want to set up a profile or see what other products can
be recommended to them.

- Frequent User- <br>
Frequent users may be investing in their skincare, taking their time to learn what their
skin needs and products available to them, skincare can be very expensive and there is a lot of information
to take all at once. With their profile saved, they can log in any time to learn about their skin
at their own pace and invest in skin products they choose when it suits them to.
